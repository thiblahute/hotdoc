# Installing

## System-wide dependencies

### lxml

Hotdoc uses lxml, which depends on libxml2 and libxslt.

### cmake

For now, hotdoc bundles its own version of [libcmark](https://github.com/jgm/cmark) as a submodule, and builds it using cmake, which thus needs to be installed on the system.

### pyyaml

Hotdoc uses pyyaml to parse yaml ‘front-matter’ metadata in markdown pages, it depends on libyaml.

### flex

flex is an optional dependency, which enables the C and GI extensions. See [][Build options] for more info.

### clang and llvm-config

Clang and llvm-config are runtime dependencies for the C extension. 

### glib and json-glib

The search extension is implemented in C, and index creation depends on [glib](https://developer.gnome.org/glib/) and [json-glib](https://developer.gnome.org/json-glib/).

### Command-line install

On Fedora you can install all these dependencies with:

```
dnf install python3-devel libxml2-devel libxslt-devel cmake libyaml-devel clang-devel llvm-devel glib2-devel json-glib-devel flex
```

And on ubuntu / debian:

```
apt-get install python3-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev cmake libyaml-dev libclang-dev llvm-dev libglib2.0-dev libjson-glib-dev flex
```

On mac OS with brew:

```
brew install python3 llvm glib json-glib flex pkg-config libxml2 cmake bison
# Fix with the right version of libxml
echo 'export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/libffi/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/local/Cellar/libxml2/2.9.9_2/lib/pkgconfig/"' >> ~/.bash_profile
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/bison/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

We'll be happy to merge updates to this list if you have successfully built hotdoc on another platform.

## Creating a virtualenv

It is highly recommended to use a virtual env to try out any new python project, and hotdoc is no exception. You can however skip this step if you really do not
mind installing hotdoc system-wide.

> Assuming [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) is installed

```
python3 -m pip install virtualenv
python3 -m venv hotdoc_env
. hotdoc_env/bin/activate
```

You are now in a virtual environment, to exit it you may call `deactivate`, to enter it again simply call `. hotdoc_env/bin/activate` from the directory in which the environment was created.

## Hotdoc itself

### Build options

To ensure that extensions with optional dependencies are enabled when installing hotdoc, the setup script will look at the following environment variables:

- `HOTDOC_BUILD_C_EXTENSION`: one of `enabled`, `disabled` or `auto`. Default is `auto`

This awkward way of passing options is due to setuptools' limitations.

### Install methods

Three main alternatives are available:

* Using pip to get the last released version of hotdoc:
  ```
  python3 -m pip install hotdoc
  ```

* Installing a "read-only" version from a github clone:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/hotdoc/hotdoc.git
  cd hotdoc
  python3 setup.py install
  ```

* Installing an editable version from a github clone:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/hotdoc/hotdoc.git
  cd hotdoc
  python3 -m pip install -e .[dev]
  ```
